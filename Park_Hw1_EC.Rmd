## Basics-----------

    # arithmetic, interacting with the interpreter

        # basic arithmetic operations

```{r}
2 + 3 # addition
2 - 3 # subtraction
2*3   # multiplication
2/3   # division
2^3   # exponentiation
```

        # precedence of operators
        
```{r}
4^2 - 3*2
1 - 6 + 4
2^-3

(4^2) - (3*2) # use parentheses to group. It also adds some clarity.
4 + 3^2
(4 + 3)^2

-2--3
-2 - -3 # use spaces for clarity
```
 
 # functions, arguments to functions, obtaining help and information
```{r}
log(100) # natural log
log(100, base = 10) # log base-10
log10(100) # equivalent
log(100, b = 10)  # argument abbreviation

args(log) # arguments of the log() function

help("log")    # documentation
? log           # equivalent 
example("log") # execute examples in help page

log(100, 10)  #  specifying arguments by position

apropos("log") # What's this?
## apropos returns a character vector. It returns objects with "log" in it. 
help.search("log") 

RSiteSearch("loglinear", "functions") #Try to find something else!

```
 
 # creating vectors
```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4)  # combine

1:4     # integer-sequence operator
4:1
-1:2    # note precedence
-(1:2)
seq(1, 4)
seq(2, 8, by = 2) # specify interval
seq(0, 1, by = 0.1) # non-integer sequence
seq(0, 1, length = 11) # specify number of elements
```

 # vectorized arithmetic
```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4)/2
c(1, 2, 3, 4)/c(4, 3, 2, 1)
log(c(0.1, 1, 10, 100), 10)

c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(4, 3) # recycling: no warning
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(4, 3, 2) # produces warning. Why?
```
    
## 2 is a multiple of 4 but 3 is not a multiple of 4. 

 # creating variables (named objects) by assignment
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4) # assignment
x # print

x = c(1, 2, 3, 4) # can use = for assignment (best avoided)
x
```
 # Briefly explain the difference between <- and = (if any)

## <- is an assignment operator. = is an equal sign that has lower precedence than <-.
```{r}
x/2            # equivalent to c(1, 2, 3, 4)/2
(y <- sqrt(x)) # parentheses to assign and print trick

(x <- rnorm(100))
head(x) # first few
summary(x)  # a "generic" function
```

 # character and logical data
```{r}
(words <- c("To", "be", "or", "not", "to", "be"))
paste(words, collapse =" ")

(logical.values <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
!logical.values # negation (not operator)
```

    # coercion
```{r}
sum(logical.values)      # number of TRUE (coercion to numeric)
sum(!logical.values)     # number of FALSE (TRUE-> 1, FALSE -> 0)
c("A", FALSE, 3.0)       # coerced to character
c(10, FALSE, -6.5, TRUE) # coerced to numeric
```

  # basic indexing
```{r}
x[12]             # 12th element
words[2]          # second element
logical.values[3] # third element
x[6:15]           # elements 6 through 15
x[c(1, 3, 5)]     # 1st, 3rd, 5th elements 

x[-(11:100)] # omit elements 11 through 100
x[1:10]      # same!
```

  # What happened with the 0th element? Do you know of any
  # other language that uses 0-based numbering?

## Python has a 0 based numbering system. 

```{r}
v <- 1:4
v[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)] # logical indexing
```

 #comparison and logical operators
```{r}
1 == 2       # equal to
1 != 2       # not equal to
1 <= 2       # less than or equal to
1 < 1:3      # less than (vectorized) 
3:1 > 1:3    # greater than
3:1 >= 1:3   # greater than or equal to

TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE)                        # logical and
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) | c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) # logical or

(z <- x[1:10])      # first 10 elements of x
z < -0.5            # is each element less than -0.5?
z > 0.5             # is each element greater than 0.5
z < -0.5 | z > 0.5  #  < and > are of higher precedence than |
abs(z) > 0.5        # absolute value, equivalent to last expression
z[abs(z) > 0.5]     # values of z for which |z| > 0.5
```

  # user-defined functions.
  # This will come in handy later! 
```{r}
mean(x)  # of 100 random-normal numbers

sum(x)/length(x)  # equivalent
```

  # Pack that into a function
```{r}
myMean <- function(x) {
    sum(x)/length(x)
}
myMean # can be printed like any object

myMean(x)
y # from sqrt(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
myMean(y)
myMean(1:100)
head(x) # global x undisturbed

mySD <- function(x) {
  sqrt(sum((x - myMean(x))^2)/(length(x) - 1))
}
mySD(1:100)
sd(1:100) # check
```

    # cleaning up
```{r}
objects()
remove(v, x, y, z, logical.values, words)
objects()
```

    # using traceback()
```{r eval=FALSE}
letters
mySD(letters)

traceback()
```
## Workflow-------------

# Using scripts

    # Let's play a bit with a sample dataset.
    # In general, you'll first load packages and then use particular
    # functions. For now, we will just briefly describe the data and
    # generate a simple plot.
    
```{r}
library("car")      # load car package (for functions and data)

data(mtcars)
head(mtcars, n = 10)  # first 10 cases
brief(mtcars)       # abbreviated output. What is this for?
```

## To get a snapshot of the variables (including classes) in the data frame.

```{r}
library("car") 
dim(mtcars)         # rows and columns
# View(mtcars)        # in the RStudio data viewer. Not always ideal...
summary(mtcars)     # Using the summary() generic function
help("mtcars")      # Some extra information...
```

        # Examining the Data
```{r}
with(mtcars, hist(mpg)) #What is with for?
```

## With allows you to modify the data with changing the original data. 
## This is to see if the data is normally distributed.

```{r}
scatterplotMatrix( ~ prestige + education + income, 
                   id = list(n = 3), data = Duncan)
```

## I always thought this data was interesting because ministers make little relative to their education. 
## However, the Duncan and Blau data was collected in the 1960's so a lot has changed since then. 
## Like teachers are paid worse for their levels of education compared to other professions.
